## 1. Project Overview

The AI-Powered Personal Study Assistant is a full-stack web application that transforms how students learn from complex materials. The platform combines intelligent document processing with evidence-based learning techniques to create a comprehensive study environment.

### Core Capabilities
- **Document Processing:** Upload and parse PDFs, PowerPoints, and Word documents with automatic text extraction
- **AI-Generated Study Aids:** Automatically create flashcards and quizzes from uploaded content
- **Conversational Q&A:** Chat with an AI assistant grounded in the user's specific documents
- **Spaced Repetition:** SM-2 algorithm implementation for optimized long-term retention
- **Progress Analytics:** Dashboard tracking study streaks, time spent, and review schedules

### Technical Stack
| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|--------------|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Recharts |
| Backend | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL |
| AI | Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5, Ollama (local alternative) |
| Deployment | Docker, Render.com, Nginx |

---

## 3. Data Collection and Preprocessing

This application does not train custom models; instead, it processes user-uploaded documents for AI consumption.

### Document Parsing Pipeline
```
Upload → Format Detection → Text Extraction → Chunking → AI Processing
```

| Format | Library | Extraction Method |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| PDF | PyPDF2 | Page-by-page text extraction |
| PPTX | python-pptx | Slide text and notes extraction |
| DOCX | python-docx | Paragraph and table text extraction |

### Preprocessing Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Large PDFs exceed context limits | Implemented text chunking; focused extraction on key sections |
| Inconsistent formatting across sources | Normalized whitespace and removed artifacts before AI processing |
| Scanned PDFs (image-based) | Noted as limitation; OCR integration identified as future work |

---

## 4. AI Tool Setup

Rather than training custom models, this project leverages large language models via API with carefully engineered prompts.

### Model Selection

**Primary Model:** Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5

Initially prototyped with OpenAI GPT-3.5, but migrated to Claude due to:
- More reliable structured JSON output
- Better instruction-following for complex generation tasks
- Improved cost efficiency at expected usage volumes

**Alternative:** Ollama with Llama 3 for privacy-focused, offline-capable deployment.

### AI-Powered Features

| Feature | Prompt Strategy | Output Format |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| Flashcard Generation | Extract key concepts; format as Q&A pairs | JSON array of {front, back} objects |
| Quiz Generation | Create multiple-choice questions with explanations | JSON with questions, options, correct answers |
| Conversational Q&A | Document-grounded chat with source citations | Natural language with reference markers |
| Auto-Categorization | Classify document by academic subject | Single category label |

### Prompt Engineering Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Inconsistent JSON formatting | Added explicit format instructions; implemented response cleaning function to strip markdown wrappers |
| Hallucinated content in Q&A | Grounded responses by including document text in context; instructed model to cite sources |
| Variable flashcard quality | Refined prompts to specify "one concept per card" and "testable knowledge" criteria |

### Response Processing
```python
def clean_json_response(response: str) -> dict:
    """Strip markdown code blocks and parse JSON."""
    cleaned = re.sub(r'```json\s*', '', response)
    cleaned = re.sub(r'```\s*', '', cleaned)
    return json.loads(cleaned.strip())
```

## 5. User Interface Design and Integration

### Design Principles
1. **Minimal Cognitive Load:** Students process complex material; the interface stays out of the way
2. **Progressive Disclosure:** Core features visible immediately; advanced options revealed contextually
3. **Immediate Feedback:** Every action provides clear status indication

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Key Interactions |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Document Library | Central hub for uploaded materials | Upload, search, filter, delete |
| FlashcardViewer | Card-based review interface | Flip animation, SM-2 rating buttons |
| QuizInterface | Multiple-choice assessment | Answer selection, immediate feedback |
| ChatWindow | Document-grounded Q&A | Message history, source citations |
| Dashboard | Progress analytics | Streak display, time charts, due reviews |

### Frontend-Backend Integration

Each UI component maps to corresponding FastAPI endpoints:
- `POST /api/documents/upload` → UploadZone
- `POST /api/flashcards/generate` → GenerationDialog
- `POST /api/chat` → ChatWindow
- `GET /api/progress/dashboard` → Dashboard

### UI/Integration Challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Generation latency confusion | Added spinner with "Generating..." text; disabled button during processing |
| Chat scroll behavior | Implemented auto-scroll to bottom via `useEffect` on message array changes |
| Flashcard flip inconsistency | Used `transform-style: preserve-3d` with explicit `backface-visibility` |

## 6. Testing and Refinement

### Testing Methodology

**Usability Testing**
- 5 participants 
- Task-based evaluation with think-aloud protocol
- 20–30 minutes per session

**Accessibility Audit**
- Standard: WCAG 2.1 Level AA performed by Claude Opus 4.5
- Scope: All 7 primary frontend components

### Key Findings and Fixes

| Issue Source | Finding | Fix Implemented |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| Usability | Generation status unclear | Spinner + disabled state during AI processing |
| Usability | Flashcard count not configurable | Added dropdown selector (5, 10, 15 cards) |
| Accessibility | UploadZone keyboard-inaccessible | Added `role="button"`, `tabIndex`, `onKeyDown` handler |
| Accessibility | Missing focus indicators | Added `focus:ring-2` to all interactive elements |
| Accessibility | Icon-only buttons unlabeled | Added descriptive `aria-label` attributes |
| Accessibility | Color-only quiz feedback | Added ✓/✗ icons alongside color indicators |
| Accessibility | Dynamic content not announced | Added `aria-live` regions for status updates |
| Accessibility | Keyboard navigation difficult | Added skip-to-content link |

### Accessibility Compliance

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Overall WCAG Compliance | ~70% | ~92% |
| Priority Fixes Completed | 0/9 | 7/9 |

## 7. Conclusions

The AI-Powered Personal Study Assistant successfully demonstrates the integration of large language models into an educational technology application. Key accomplishments include:

- **Functional full-stack application** with document processing, AI-generated study aids, and spaced repetition
- **Production deployment** on Render.com with Docker containerization
- **92% WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance** following accessibility audit and remediation
- **Iterative development** with user feedback integration

### Technical Insights

1. **LLM selection matters:** Migrating from OpenAI to Anthropic significantly improved structured output reliability
2. **Async architecture is essential:** FastAPI's async support prevented blocking during AI response generation
3. **Accessibility requires early investment:** Retrofitting ARIA labels and keyboard support proved more time-consuming than building them in initially

### Limitations

- No user authentication (single-user mode only)
- Limited mobile responsiveness
- No OCR for scanned/image-based documents
- Incomplete focus management in modal dialogs
